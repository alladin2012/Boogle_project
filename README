Welcome to our Mind-Boggling Boggle game!
Boggle is a board game, where you've got a randomized letters board and you need
to make as many words as you can. Each word grants a score of square its path!

In our version, we've added Hints^tm:
Hints will provide you with the starting letters of a max-score word on the board.
Set your difficulty level to receive hints:
1. Easy - get half of the word completed
2. Medium - get third of the word completed
3. Hard - don't get hints at all

Try to get the best score - your session's High Score^tm will be saved, so try and
beat your own high score!
